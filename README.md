# 4D-Rendering
Based on a Unity framework for 4 dimentional raymarching

What we did:
    - Added reflection code to the ray marching shaders
    - Implemented a script for creating a Four Dimensional menger sponge
    - Change the camera setup for rendering higher-definition frames using Path Tracing
    - Implemented a few more 4D primitives:
        -

What we borrowed:
    - Raymarching framework
    - basic distance functions for 4d objects
